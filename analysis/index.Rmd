### Level

Intermediate

### Prerequisites:

Familiarity with Version Control through RStudio and rmarkdown.


### System Requirements:

#### Pandoc (>= 1.17.2)

#### LaTeX

If you don't have LaTeX installed, consider installing `TinyTeX`, a custom LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live that is small in size but functions well in most cases, especially for R users. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Check [docs](https://yihui.name/tinytex/) before before installing.


#### `devtools` requirements

You might also need a set of **development tools** to install and run `devtools`. On **Windows**, download and install [**Rtools**](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), and `devtools` takes care of the rest. On **Mac**, install the [**Xcode**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) command line tools. On **Linux**, install the **R development package**, usually called **`r-devel`** or **`r-base-dev`**.
