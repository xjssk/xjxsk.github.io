```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
```

## Workshop setup

<br>

### Launch Rstudio

Let's begin by **launching Rstudio**


<br>

### Install packages

Next, let's **install the packages we'll need, starting with `rrtools`** (if you haven't got devtools installed, you'll need to before you can install `rrtools` from GitHub). 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("benmarwick/rrtools")
```

Installing `rrtools` **imports many of the packages we'll need today** (eg, have a look at the imports section of the [`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools/blob/master/DESCRIPTION) file).

```
Imports: devtools, git2r, whisker, rstudioapi, rmarkdown, knitr,
    bookdown, curl, RCurl, jsonlite, methods, httr, usethis, clisymbols,
    crayon, glue, readr (>= 1.1.1)
```

Now, **install some additional packages** we'll need for the workshop.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c(
    # source paper analysis
    "dplyr", "ggplot2", "ggthemes", "here",
    # bibliographic / publishing
    "citr", "rticles",
    # documentation
    "roxygen2",
    # graphics
    "Cairo"))
```

<br>

### Get workshop materials

Today we'll be working with **a subset of materials from the published compendium** of code, data, and author's manuscript: 

##### Carl Boettiger. (2018, April 17). *cboettig/noise-phenomena: Supplement to: "From noise to knowledge: how randomness generates novel phenomena and reveals information"* (Version revision-2). *Zenodo*. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1219780

accompanying the publication:

##### Carl Boettiger [![](https://orcid.org/sites/default/files/images/orcid_16x16.png)](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1642-628X). *From noise to knowledge: how randomness generates novel phenomena and reveals information*.  Published in *Ecology Letters*, 22 May 2018 <https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13085>

<img src="assets/Boettiger-2018.png" heigth="250px" width="400px">


You can **download the materials using `usethis::use_course()`** and supplying a path to a destination folder to argument `destdir`: 

```{r}
usethis::use_course(url = "bit.ly/rrtools_wks", destdir = "~/Desktop")
```

This will **download** everything we need from a GitHub repository as a `.zip` file, **unzip** it and launch it in a **new Rstudio session** for us to explore.

<br>

#### Inspect materials

```
├── README.md <- .......................repo README
├── analysis.R <- ......................analysis underlying paper
├── gillespie.csv <- ...................data
├── paper.pdf <- .......................LaTex pdf of the paper
├── paper.txt <- .......................text body of the paper
├── refs.bib <- ........................bibtex bibliographic file
└── rrtools-wkshp-materials.Rproj <- ...rstudio project file
```

<br>

In this workshop we'll attempt **a partial reproduction of the original paper** using the materials we've just downloaded.

We'll **use this as an opportunity to create a new research compendium using `rrtools` and friends!** `r emo::ji("confetti")`

<br>

---


## Create compendium

Now that we've got all the materials we need, let's start by ***creating a blank research compendium** for us to work in.

<br>

### load library

First we need to load `rrtools`
```{r}
library(rrtools) 
```

This performs a quick check to **confirm you have Git installed and configured**

If you do, you should see the following output in the console.

```r
✔ Git is installed on this computer, your username is annakrystalli
```

#### configure `git`

If your git configuration hasn't been set yet, you can use `usethis::use_git_config()`

**Set git configuration:**

```{r}
usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "Jane", user.email = "jane@example.org")
```

**Check git configuration:**

```{r}
usethis::use_git_config()
```

```
$user.name
[1] "Jane"

$user.email
[1] "jane@example.org"
```
<br>


### create compendium

Now we're ready to **create our compendium**. We use function **`rrtools::use_compendium`** and supply it with a path at which our compendium will be created. The final part of our path becomes the compendium name. Because the function effectively creates a package, only a **single string of lowercase alpha characters is accepted as a name**. so let's go for `rrcompendium` as the final part of our path.

To **create `rrcompendium` in a directory called `Documents/workflows/` I use:**

```{r}
rrtools::use_compendium("~/Documents/workflows/rrcompendium")
```

Go ahead and **create a compendium at a location of your choice**. Stick with compendium name `rrcompendium` for ease of following the materials. If the call was successfull you should see the following console output:

```
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/Anna/Documents/workflows/rrcompendium'
✔ Creating 'R/'
✔ Creating 'man/'
✔ Writing 'DESCRIPTION'
✔ Writing 'NAMESPACE'
✔ Writing 'rrcompendium.Rproj'
✔ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'
✔ Adding '^rrcompendium\\.Rproj$', '^\\.Rproj\\.user$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Opening new project 'rrcompendium' in RStudio
✔ The package rrcompendium has been created
✔ Opening the new compendium in a new RStudio session...

Next, you need to:  ↓ ↓ ↓ 
● Edit the DESCRIPTION file
● Use other 'rrtools' functions to add components to the compendium
```

and a new Rstudio session launched for the compendium:

<img src="assets/create-compendium.png" heigth="500px">

<br>


### Initiate `git`

We can initialise our compendium with `.git` using:

```{r}
usethis::use_git()
```


**N.B. Beware, you may have ended up with two Rstudio sessions of `rrcompendium`.** Make sure to only have one session of a single project at one time to avoid problems.

<br>


### Inspect templates

```
.
├── DESCRIPTION <- .............................package metadata
|                                               dependency management
├── NAMESPACE <- ...............................AUTO-GENERATED on build
├── R <- .......................................folder for functions
├── man <- .....................................AUTO-GENERATED on build
└── rrcompendium.Rproj <- ......................rstudio project file
```

`rrtools::use_compendium()` creates the **bare backbone of infrastructure required for a research compendium**. At this point it provides facilities to store general metadata about our compendium (eg bibliographic details to create a citation) and manage dependencies in the `DESCRIPTION` file and store and document functions in the `R/` folder. Together these allow us to **manage, install and share functionality associated with our project**.

<br>


### update description file

Let's **update some basic details in the `DESCRIPTION` file**:

```
Package: rrcompendium
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "First",
           family = "Last",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "first.last@example.com")
Description: What the package does (one paragraph)
License: What license it uses
ByteCompile: true
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true

```
<br>

### Title

Let's start with **giving our compendium a descriptive title**:

```
Title: Partial Reproduction of Boettiger Ecology Letters 2018;21:1255–1267 
    with rrtools
```
<br>

### Version

We don't need to change the version now but using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for our compendium can be a really useful way to track versions. In general, **versions below `0.0.1` are in development**, hence the `DESCRIPTION` file defaults to `0.0.0.9000`.


<br>

### Authors

Next let's **specify the author of the compendium**. Edit with **your own details**.

```
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Anna",
           family = "Krystalli",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "annakrystalli@googlemail.com")
```
For more details on specifying authors, check documentation for `?person`

<br>


### Description

Let's **add a bit more detail about the contents of the compendium** in the Description.

```
Description: This repository contains the research compendium of the 
    partial reproduction of Boettiger Ecology Letters 2018;21:1255–1267. 
    The compendium contains all data, code, and text associated with this       sub-section of the analysis
```
<br>


### License

Finally, let's **add a license for the material we create**. We'll use an [**MIT license**](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Note however that **his only covers the code**. We can do this with:

```{r}
 usethis::use_mit_license(name = "My Name")
```

```
✔ Setting License field in DESCRIPTION to 'MIT + file LICENSE'
✔ Writing 'LICENSE.md'
✔ Adding '^LICENSE\\.md$' to '.Rbuildignore'
```
This creates files `LICENSE` and `LICENSE.md` and updates the `DESCRIPTION` file with details of the license. 

```
License: MIT + file LICENSE
```

<br>


### Recap

We've finished updating our `DESCRIPTION` file! `r emo::ji("tada")`

It should look a bit like this:

```
Package: rrcompendium
Title: Partial Reproduction of Boettiger Ecology Letters 2018;21:1255–1267 
    with rrtools
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Anna",
           family = "Krystalli",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "annakrystalli@googlemail.com")
Description: This repository contains the research compendium of the partial 
    reproduction of Boettiger Ecology Letters 2018;21:1255–1267. The compendium 
    contains all data, code, and text associated with this sub-section of the 
    analysis.
License: MIT + file LICENSE
ByteCompile: true
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true

```

and your project folder should contain:

```
.
├── DESCRIPTION
├── LICENSE
├── LICENSE.md
├── NAMESPACE
├── R
├── man
└── rrcompendium.Rproj
```

Let's commit our work and move on to preparing our compendium for sharing on GitHub.


<br>

***

## Sharing a compendium on GitHub

<br>

### Set up GITHUB PAT

You'll **need a Personal Authorisation Token (PAT) from GitHub** to be able to **interact with GitHub through R**.

Use:

```{r, eval=F}
usethis::browse_github_pat()
```

to open up the **GitHub panel to generate your PAT**. 


<img src="assets/browse_github.png" height="300px">


**Copy the generated PAT** to **paste into your `.Renviron`** file as system variable **`GITHUB_PAT`**.

You  can **open your `.Renviron` file for editing** with:

```{r, eval=F}
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

**Paste your copied PAT into your `.Renviron`** file as system variable `GITHUB_PAT`, save and close. Now everytime R is reloaded, your PAT will be stored
in system variable `GITHUB_PAT`.

<img src="assets/GITHUB_PAT.png" height="300px">

<br>

### Create GitHub repository

Next, we'll **create a GitHub repository to share our compendium**. We'll make use of our `GITHUB_PAT` and go for `https` authentication. We can do this with function:

```{r}
usethis::use_github(protocol = "https")
```

```
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/Anna/Documents/workflows/rrcompendium'
● Check title and description
  Name:        rrcompendium
  Description: Partial Reproduction of Boettiger Ecology Letters 2018;21:1255–1267 with rrtools
  
```
The function will prompt you to confirm the name and description for your GitHub repo which it parses from our `DESCRIPTION` file. If everything looks good select the affirmative option.

```
Are title and description ok?
1: Not now
2: Definitely
3: Nope

```
If creation of the repo was successfull you should see the following console output:

```
✔ Creating GitHub repository
✔ Adding GitHub remote
✔ Adding GitHub links to DESCRIPTION
✔ Setting URL field in DESCRIPTION to 'https://github.com/annakrystalli/rrcompendium'
✔ Setting BugReports field in DESCRIPTION to 'https://github.com/annakrystalli/rrcompendium/issues'
✔ Pushing to GitHub and setting remote tracking branch
✔ Opening URL https://github.com/annakrystalli/rrcompendium
```


<br>

### Create README

Every GitHub repository needs a `README` landing page.

We can **create an `rrtools` `README` template** using:

```{r}
rrtools::use_readme_rmd()
```

```

✔ Creating 'README.Rmd' from template.
✔ Adding 'README.Rmd' to `.Rbuildignore`.
● Modify 'README.Rmd'
✔ Rendering README.Rmd to README.md for GitHub.
✔ Adding code of conduct.
✔ Creating 'CONDUCT.md' from template.
✔ Adding 'CONDUCT.md' to `.Rbuildignore`.
✔ Adding instructions to contributors.
✔ Creating 'CONTRIBUTING.md' from template.
✔ Adding 'CONTRIBUTING.md' to `.Rbuildignore`.

```

This **generates [README.Rmd](README.Rmd) and renders it to [README.md](README.md)**, ready to display on GitHub. It contains:

+ a **template citation** to show others how to cite your project.
+ **license information for the text, figures, code and data** in your
        compendium


```

+ `CONTRIBUTING.md`:: basic **instructions for people who want to contribute** to our compendium

<br>

### update `README`

There's **five main edits** we need to make to the template:

#### edit compendium DOI details

Although we don't have a link to the DOI, we can complete the rest of the details and leave it as a place holder. 

```
This repository contains the data and code for our reproduction paper:

> Krystalli, A, (2018). _Partial Reproduction of Boettiger Ecology Letters 2018;21:1255–1267 with rrtools_.  <https://doi.org/{DOI-to-paper}>
```

#### edit paper.pdf DOI

```
Our reproduction pre-print is online here:

> Krystalli, A, (2018). _Partial Reproduction of Boettiger Ecology Letters 2018;21:1255–1267 with rrtools_, Accessed `r format(Sys.Date(), "%d %b %Y")`. Online at <https://doi.org/{DOI-to-compendium}>

```

#### edit compendium citation
```
Please cite this compendium as:

> Krystalli, A, (`r format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")`). _Compendium of R code and data for 'Partial Reproduction of Boettiger Ecology Letters 2018;21:1255–1267 with rrtools'_. Accessed `r format(Sys.Date(), "%d %b %Y")`. Online at <https://doi.org/{DOI-to-compendium}>
```

#### update zip url

This is a link to download a zipped file of the repository. To update the template, just paste the url of your compendium repository like so:

```
### How to download or install

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL: <https://github.com/annakrystalli/rrcompendium/archive/master.zip>
```

#### adjust data LICENSE

Let's **adjust the data LICENSE to match the source compendium license**, which is CC-BY 4.0. Let's also add Carl Boettiger as copyright holder of the data.

```
**Text and figures :**  [CC-BY-4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), Copyright (c) 2018 Carl Boettiger.

**Code :** See the [DESCRIPTION](DESCRIPTION) file

**Data :** [CC-BY-4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), Copyright (c) 2018 Carl Boettiger.
```

<br>

### render README.md, commit and push to GitHub

#### We've now completed our `rrtools` `README.Rmd`! `r emo::ji("tada")`

- Render it to update the `README.md` file which is displayed on GitHub

- Commit and push to GitHub.

You're Github repository README should look like this on the site:

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = F}
webshot::webshot(url = "https://github.com/annakrystalli/rrcompendium/blob/master/README.md", 
                 file = here::here("docs/assets/README-webshot.png"),
                 cliprect = c( 850, 0, 1000, 920))
```


![](assets/README-webshot.png)


---


and your project folder should contain:
```
.
├── CONDUCT.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── DESCRIPTION
├── LICENSE
├── LICENSE.md
├── NAMESPACE
├── R
├── README.Rmd
├── README.md
├── man
└── rrcompendium.Rproj
```

<br>

***

## Setting up the analysis folder

<br>


### Create `analysis`

We now need an **analysis folder to contain our analysis and paper**. We can do this using function `rrtools::use_analysis()`

The function has three `location =` options: 

- `top_level` to create a top-level `analysis/` directory

- `inst` to create an `inst/` directory (so that all the sub-directories are available after the package is installed)

- `vignettes` to create a `vignettes/` directory (and automatically update the `DESCRIPTION`). 

The default is a top-level `analysis/`.

```{r}
rrtools::use_analysis()
```


```
✔ Adding bookdown to Imports
✔ Creating 'analysis' directory and contents
✔ Creating 'analysis'
✔ Creating 'analysis/paper'
✔ Creating 'analysis/figures'
✔ Creating 'analysis/templates'
✔ Creating 'analysis/data'
✔ Creating 'analysis/data/raw_data'
✔ Creating 'analysis/data/derived_data'
✔ Creating 'references.bib' from template.
✔ Creating 'paper.Rmd' from template.

Next, you need to:  ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ 
● Write your article/report/thesis, start at the paper.Rmd file
● Add the citation style library file (csl) to replace the default provided here, see https://github.com/citation-style-language/
● Add bibliographic details of cited items to the 'references.bib' file
● For adding captions & cross-referencing in an Rmd, see https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/
● For adding citations & reference lists in an Rmd, see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html

Note that:
⚠ Your data files are tracked by Git and will be pushed to GitHub
```

Regardless for `location` option, the contents of the created sub-directories are the same:

```
    analysis/
    |
    ├── paper/
    │   ├── paper.Rmd       # this is the main document to edit
    │   └── references.bib  # this contains the reference list information
    
    ├── figures/            # location of the figures produced by the Rmd
    |
    ├── data/
    │   ├── DO-NOT-EDIT-ANY-FILES-IN-HERE-BY-HAND
    │   ├── raw_data/       # data obtained from elsewhere
    │   └── derived_data/   # data generated during the analysis
    |
    └── templates
        ├── journal-of-archaeological-science.csl
        |                   # this sets the style of citations & reference list
        ├── template.docx   # used to style the output of the paper.Rmd
        └── template.Rmd
```

Let's inspect

#### `paper.Rmd`

`paper.Rmd` is ready to write in and render with bookdown. It includes:

- a YAML header that identifies the `references.bib` file and the supplied `csl` file (Citation Style Language) to style the reference list)

- a **colophon** that **adds some git commit details to the end of the document**. This means that the output file (HTML/PDF/Word) is always traceable to a specific state of the code.
        
#### `references.bib`

The `references.bib` file has just one item to demonstrate the format. It is ready to insert more reference details.

We can replace the supplied `csl` file with a different citation style from <https://github.com/citation-style-language/>

<br>

***

Next, let's set up functionality as a [package](package.html)!
