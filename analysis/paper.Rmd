```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
```


In this section we're going to **create a literate programming document to reproduce the paper** in a format suitable for **journal submission** or as a **pre-print**. We'll do this using the course materials we downloaded. 

In particular, we're going to **combine** the **code in `analysis.R`**, the **`text` in `paper.txt`** and the **references in the `refs.bib`** file in an `.Rmd` document to reproduce [`paper.pdf`](https://github.com/annakrystalli/rrtools-wkshp-materials/blob/master/paper.pdf).

More information on working on [academic journals with Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/journals.html)

<br>

## Create journal article template using `rticles`

The `rticles` package is designed to **simplify the creation of documents that conform to submission standards**. A suite of custom R Markdown templates for popular journals is provided by the package.

<br>

### delete `paper/` subdirectory

First, let's **delete the current `analysis/paper` folder** as we're going to create a new `paper.Rmd` template.

<br>

### create new paper template

This particular paper was published in Ecology Letters, an Elsevier Journal. We can **create a new paper.Rmd template** from the templates provided by `rticles` package.

We can use the **New R Markdown** dialog

Select:

- **Template:** Elesevier Journal Article
- **Name:** paper
- **Location:** `~/Documents/workflows/rrcompendium/analysis`

![](assets/rticle.png)

Or we can use `rmarkdown::draft()` to create articles:

```{r}
rmarkdown::draft(here::here("analysis","paper.Rmd"), template = "elsevier_article", package = "rticles")
```

Both these functions create the following files in a new directory `analysis/paper`. 

```
analysis/paper
├── elsarticle.cls
├── mybibfile.bib
├── numcompress.sty
└── paper.Rmd
```

- The `elsarticle.cls` contains contains the citation language style for the references. 

- The `mybibfile.bib` contains an example reference list. 

- The new `paper.Rmd` is the file we will be working in.

Let's open it up and start editing it.

***
<br>

## Update YAML

The **YAML header in `Paper.Rmd`** contains **document wide metadata** and is pre-populated with some fields relevant to an academic publication.

```

---
title: Short Paper
author:
  - name: Alice Anonymous
    email: alice@example.com
    affiliation: Some Institute of Technology
    footnote: Corresponding Author
  - name: Bob Security
    email: bob@example.com
    affiliation: Another University
address:
  - code: Some Institute of Technology
    address: Department, Street, City, State, Zip
  - code: Another University
    address: Department, Street, City, State, Zip
abstract: |
  This is the abstract.

  It consists of two paragraphs.

journal: "An awesome journal"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
bibliography: mybibfile.bib
output: rticles::elsevier_article
---
```

Here we're **going to reproduce `paper.pdf` as is**, so we'll actually be editing the file with **details from the original publication**.

First, let's **clear all text BELOW the YAML header** (which is **delimited by `---`**. DO NOT delete the YAML header).

Next, let's **open `paper.txt`** from the course material which contains all text from the in `paper.pdf`. We can **use it to complete some of the fields in the YAML header**.

<br>

### title

Add the paper title to this field

```
title: "From noise to knowledge: how randomness generates novel phenomena and reveals information"

```
<br>

### author

Here we specify author details.

```
author:
  - name: "Carl Boettiger"
    affiliation: a
    email: "cboettig@berkeley.edu"
```

<br>

### address

Here we **specify the addresses associated with the affiliations** specified in `authors`

```
address:
  - code: a
    address: "Dept of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley CA 94720-3114, USA"
```

Note that the field `code` in `address` cross-references with the affiliations specified in `author`.

<br>

### bibliography

Before specifying the bibliography, we need to **copy the `refs.bib`** file associated with `paper.pdf` from the course materials and **save it in our `analysis/paper`** subdirectory.

Next we can set the `refs.bib` as the source for our paper's bibliograpraphy:

```
bibliography: refs.bib
```
<br>

### layout

We can add an additional field called `layout` which specifies the **layout of the output** and takes the following values.

- **review:** doublespace margins
- **3p:** singlespace margins
- **5p:** two-column

Let's **use singlespace margins**

```
layout:  3p
```
<br>

### preamble

We can add also an additional field called **`preamble`**. This **allows us to include LaTeX packages and functions**. We'll use the following to **add linenumbers and doublespacing**.

```
preamble: |
  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
  \linenumbers
  \usepackage{setspace}
  \doublespacing
```
<br>

### abstract

This field should **contain the abstract**

```
abstract: |

  # Abstract
  
  Noise, as the term itself suggests, is most often seen a nuisance to ecological insight, a inconvenient reality that must be acknowledged, a haystack that must be stripped away to reveal the processes of interest underneath. Yet despite this well-earned reputation, noise is often interesting in its own right: noise can induce novel phenomena that could not be understood from some underlying determinstic model alone.  Nor is all noise the same, and close examination of differences in frequency, color or magnitude can reveal insights that would otherwise be inaccessible.  Yet with each aspect of stochasticity leading to some new or unexpected behavior, the time is right to move beyond the familiar refrain of "everything is important" (Bjørnstad & Grenfell 2001).  Stochastic phenomena can suggest new ways of inferring process from pattern, and thus spark more dialog between theory and empirical perspectives that best advances the field as a whole. I highlight a few compelling examples, while observing that the study of stochastic phenomena are only beginning to make this translation into empirical inference.  There are rich opportunities at this interface in the years ahead.  

```

### output

The **output format**. In this case, the template is correctly pre-populated with `rticles::elsevier_article` so no need to edit.

```
output: rticles::elsevier_article
```

<br>


***

## Add text

Now let's **add the main body of the paper from `paper.txt`**. 

<br>

### add new page after abstract

First, let's a add a new page after the abstract using:

```
\newpage

```

<br>

### copy and paste text from `paper.txt`

We do not need the details we've just completed the YAML with, so ignore the title, abstract etc and just copy everything in `paper.txt`  **from the Introduction header down to and including the reference section header**.


```
# Introduction: Noise the nuisance

To many, stochasticity, or more simply, noise,
is just that -- something which obscures patterns we are

### Check pdf output

Let's knit our document and have our first look at the resulting pdf by clicking on the **Knit** tab.

<br>

### Update references

Next we'll replace the flat citations in the text with real linked citation which can be used to **auto-generate formatted inline citations and the references section**.

#### Insert formatted citations

We'll use the **`citr` package**, which provides functions and an RStudio addin to search a BibTeX-file to **create and insert formatted Markdown citations** into the current document.

Once `citr` is installed and you have restarted your R session, the addin appears in the addin menu. The **addin will automatically look up the Bib(La)TeX-file(s) specified in the YAML front matter**.

##### To insert a citation

1. **Select text** to replace with a citation

1. **Launch `citr` addin**:
    <img src="assets/citr-addin.png" width="700px">
    
1. **Search** for citation to insert
    <img src="assets/citr-select.png" width="700px">

1. **Select** citation to insert
    <img src="assets/citr-insert.png" width="700px">

1. **Insert** citation
    <img src="assets/citr-inserted.png" width="700px">

**Carry on updating the rest of the citations**. Don't forget to check the abstract for citations!

<br>

### Update math

For the sake of time today, and not to open this topic too deeply here, I've included the following **LaTex equation syntax** in the text:

```
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d} n}{\mathrm{d} t} = \underbrace{c n \left(1 - \frac{n}{N}\right)}_{\textrm{birth}} - \underbrace{e n}_{\textrm{death}}, \label{levins}
\end{align}
```

that **generates equation 1 in the `paper.pdf`**.

\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d} n}{\mathrm{d} t} = \underbrace{c n \left(1 - \frac{n}{N}\right)}_{\textrm{birth}} - \underbrace{e n}_{\textrm{death}}, \label{levins}
\end{align}

So you don't need to edit anything here.

Check [Math expressions](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-syntax.html#math-expressions) and
[Markdown extensions by bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html) for more information.
<br>


#### update inline math

**Inline LaTeX equations and parameters** can be written **between a pair of dollar signs**  using the LaTeX syntax, e.g., `$f(x) = 1/x$` generates $f(x) = 1/x$.

Using `paper.pdf` to identify mathematical expressions in the text (generally they appear in italic), **edit your `paper.Rmd`, enclosing them between dollar signs**.


### Check pdf output

Let's knit our document to **check our references and maths annotations** have been updated correctly by clicking on the **Knit** tab.


<br>

## Add code

Now that we've set up the text for our paper, let's **insert the code to generate figure 1.**

<br>


### Add `libraries` chunk

First let's insert a `libraries` code chunk right at the top of the document to set up our analysis. Because it's a setup chunk we set `include = F` which suppresses all output resulting from chunk evaluation.

    
        `r ''````{r libraries, include=FALSE}
        
     ```


#### set document chunk options 

Now, let's set some `knitr` options for the whole document by adding the following code to our `libraries` chunk:


```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, 
                      dev="cairo_pdf", fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5)
```

We're setting default chunk options to:

- `echo = FALSE`
- `message = FALSE`
- `warning = FALSE`

to suppress code, warnings and messages in the output, and

- `dev="cairo_pdf"`
- `fig.width=7` 
- `fig.height=3.5`

to specify how figures will appear.

#### add libraries

Copy and paste the **code for loading all the libraries from `analysis.R`**. Add library `rrcompendium` so we can access function `recode_system_size`. The `libraries` chunk should now look like so:

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, 
                      dev="cairo_pdf", fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5)

library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(rrcompendium)
```

<br>


### Add `set-theme` chunk

Right below the `libraries` chunk, **insert a new chunk and call it `set-theme`**

Copy the **code to set the plot theme** and pasted into the `set-theme` code:

```{r set-theme}
theme_set(theme_grey())
```


<br>

### Add `figure1` chunk

Now **scroll down** towards the bottom of the document and **create a new chunk just above the Conclusions** section. Call it **`figure1`**

#### Add code

Copy and **paste the remaining code into a new chunk which will create figure 1**.

```{r}
# create colour palette
colours <- ptol_pal()(2)

# load-data
data <- read_csv(here::here("gillespie.csv"), col_types = "cdiddd")  

# recode-data
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(system_size = recode(system_size, large = "A. 1000 total sites", small= "B. 100 total sites")) 

# plot-gillespie
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean), lty=2, col=colours[2]) + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = minus_sd), lty=2, col=colours[2]) + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = plus_sd), lty=2, col=colours[2]) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = n), col=colours[1]) +
  facet_wrap(~system_size, scales = "free_y") 
```


#### edit code

Edit the code to

- update the path to `gillespie.csv`

- streamline the code to a single pipe to include `recode_system_size`


```{r}
read_csv(here::here("analysis", "data","raw_data", "gillespie.csv"), 
         col_types = "cdiddd")  %>% 
    # recode-data
    recode_system_size() %>% 
    # plot-gillespie
    ggplot(aes(x = time)) + 
    geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean), lty=2, col=colours[2]) + 
    geom_hline(aes(yintercept = minus_sd), lty=2, col=colours[2]) + 
    geom_hline(aes(yintercept = plus_sd), lty=2, col=colours[2]) + 
    geom_line(aes(y = n), col=colours[1]) +
    facet_wrap(~system_size, scales = "free_y") 
```


#### Add caption

Finally, let's update chunk `figure1` to **include a figure caption**. The text for the caption is at the bottom of `paper.txt`. We can include it in the chunk header through **chunk option `fig.cap`** like so:

        `r ''````{r figure1, figure1, fig.cap="Population dynamics from a Gillespie simulation of the Levins model with large (N=1000, panel A) and small (N=100, panel B) number of sites (blue) show relatively weaker effects of demographic noise in the bigger system. Models are otherwise identical, with e = 0.2 and c = 1 (code in appendix A). Theoretical predictions for mean and plus/minus one standard deviation shown in horizontal re dashed lines."} ```

<br>

***

## Render final document to pdf

Let's **check our final work by re-knitting to `pdf`**. You should be looking at something that looks a lot like `paper.pdf`

<br>

***

## Add paper dependencies

Finally, before we're finished, let's ensure the additional dependencies introduced in the paper are included. We can use `rrtools::add_dependencies_to_description()`

```{r}
rrtools::add_dependencies_to_description()
```


This function **scans script files (`.R`, `.Rmd`, `.Rnw`, `.Rpres`, etc.) for external package dependencies** indicated by `library()`, `require()` or `::` and **adds those packages to the `Imports` field in the package `DESCRIPTION`**:

```
Imports: 
    bookdown,
    dplyr,
    ggplot2 (>= 3.0.0),
    ggthemes (>= 3.5.0),
    here (>= 0.1),
    knitr (>= 1.20),
    rticles (>= 0.6)
    
```

#### `r emo::ji("hammer")` **Install and Restart**

#### Commit and push to GitHub!
