# `r emo::ji("wave")` Hello and welcome

### me: Dr Anna Krystalli

# Background

- **Research is increasingly computational**

- **Code and data are important research outputs**
    + yet, we still focus mainly on curating papers.

- **Calls for openness**
    + stick: reproducibility crisis
    + carrot: huge rewards from working open


##### Yet we lack conventions and technical infrastructure for such openness.

<br>

## Enter the Research Compendium


> The goal of a research compendium is to provide a **standard** and easily recognizable way for **organizing the digital materials** of a project to enable others to **inspect, reproduce, and extend the research**.


### Three Generic Principles

1. **Organize its files according to prevailing conventions**: 
    + help other people recognize the structure of the project, 
    + supports tool building which takes advantage of the shared structure.
    
1. **Separate of data, method, and output**, while making the relationship between them clear.

1. **Specify the computational environment** that was used for the original analysis.

##  R community response

> R packages can be used as a research compendium for organising and sharing files!

## Enter `rrtools`

> The goal of rrtools is to provide **instructions, templates, and functions** for making a **basic compendium** suitable for writing **reproducible research with R**.


**`rrtools` build on tools & conventions for R package development to**

- organise files
- manage dependencies
- share code
- document code
- check and test code

**`rrtools` extends and works with a number of R packages:**

- [`devtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools): functions for package development

- [`usethis`](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/11/usethis-1.0.0/): automates repetitive tasks that arise during project setup and development

- [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/): facilitates writing books and long-form articles/reports with R Markdown

# Workshop approach
    

## Live coding

The majority of the workshop I will be **live coding** `r emo::ji("fearful")` so that you can follow along. You will get a lot more out of the workshop if you do.

However, handouts of the materials we'll cover are available if you get stuck!


# Workshop materials

## Data

#### On github: <https://github.com/annakrystalli/rrtools-wkshp-materials/>  

+ click on **Clone or download** 

+ click on **Download ZIP** 

+ Unzip the file 

## Handouts:

#### <bit.ly/rrtools_handouts>

# Workshop aims and objectives

In this workshop we'll **use materials associated with a published paper** (text, data and code) to **create a research compendium** around it.

<br>

By the end of the workshop, you should be able to:

- Be able to **Create a Research Compendium** to manage and share resources associated with an academic publication.

- Understand the basics of **managing code as an R package**.

- Be able to **produce a reproducible manuscript from a single rmarkdown document**.

- Appreciate the power of convention!

<br>

> It’s like agreeing that we will all drive on the left or the right. A hallmark of civilization is following conventions that constrain your behavior a little, in the name of public safety.

### Level

Intermediate

### Prerequisites:

Familiarity with Version Control through RStudio and rmarkdown.


### System Requirements:

Pandoc (>= 1.17.2)
LaTeX

If you don't have LaTeX installed, consider installing `TinyTeX`, a custom LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live that is small in size but functions well in most cases, especially for R users. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Check [docs](https://yihui.name/tinytex/) before before installing.
